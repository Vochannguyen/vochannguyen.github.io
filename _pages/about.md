I'm currently a working Data Scientist, having recently earned my M.S. in Data Science from Southern Methodist Univeristy.
My passion and specialty is in AI Development and broadening my expertise by creating blogs and learning more through teaching. 
In my portfolio, you'll find case studies, teaching videos, and other projects that highlight my background in coding, AI, proofs, and other teaching materials. Please explore the navigation bar for my Core Clarity, Resume/CV, Teaching sections, and more.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball in a rec league, serving at church, and traveling with my lovely wife and daughter.
